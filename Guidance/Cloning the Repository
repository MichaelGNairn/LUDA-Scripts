To access the scripts on your local device, you will need to clone this repository.

This is essentially a local version of what is on Github. 

All instructions in the main body of this document are given for the command line software Git Bash. 


Create a folder in a local drive (I recommend using D:) to store your repositories. I (Michael Nairn) use D:/Coding_Repos.

You may need 2-factor authentication on your Github account. 
This means that you may need to use a Personal access token to get your Git to sync with Github. 
To get a Personal access token, in Github go to Settings (your settings, not the repository settings) > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens. 
Copy the token and save it. 
When you are prompted for your password from Git, use this rather than your Github password.


To copy the LUDA repo to your local drive, go to the desired directory (for me this is D:/Coding_Repos), right-click and choose 'Git Bash here'.

Type: git clone https://github.com/ONSdigital/LUDA-Scripts.git . 
A pop-up will appear. 
The ‘password’ it asks for is the personal access token that you created above.

Once you have cloned the repository, in order to access the main branch you need to navigate to the cloned folder that will now appear in your coding_repos. 
Use cd LUDA-Scripts. You should now see (main) in blue colour at the end of the directory line.

To ensure you have the most up to date version of the scripts on your local device you will need to pull any changes from the repository:
When in LUDA-Scripts (main) in Git Bash type the following:
git pull

This will pull any changes to the scripts onto your local device.
