LUDA-Scripts Folder Structure.

Each data provider for the LUDA dashboard has its own folder (e.g. NOMIS_API, Fingertips_API, Webscraping).

Within each of these folders (e.g. NOMIS API) there will be a subfolder for each metric sourced from this data provider. 

These contain an R script for generating a csv file from the API link or .csv file called within it. Please ensure the .csv file is the most up-to-date dataset. This may have changed since the previous iteration. 
Prior to running the script ensure you are in the correct working directory for you: 
  E.g. In the script it calls "D:\Coding_Repos\LUDA-Scripts\Output". The "D:\Coding_Repos" part will be different dependent upon your local file structure.
  
Running the script will generate a .csv file in the "Output" folder.


To generate .csv files containing only the most recent period of data, as required for the jitter plot, run the "Extract most recent year R Script.R" script in the "Scripts to generate final files for ingestion" folder.
