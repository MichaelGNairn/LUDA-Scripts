Moving files to your local repository (on your laptop) from the online repository using Git Bash.




General advice:
When starting work ensure to get latest version of all code:
git pull



Fetch the most recent version of the repo from Github:
Use the fetch command and then pull command if "fetch" suggests that your branch is not up to date.
Performing a pull automatically performs a fetch command first, but use fetch on its own to understand what has changed on the remote repo (if anything):
git fetch

git pull


Check what branch you are in within ONS/digital/LUDA-Scripts:
Make sure you are on the main branch - you should see (main) in blue at the end of the directory line. 
If not, use the git branch command to see a list of available branches on your local repo. There will be a green star next to the one you are currently on. 
git branch 

If you want to access the scripts used for previous iterations (e.g. August 2022) then navigate to that branch.
git checkout August 2022 Iteration
August 2022 Iteration should now be in blue at the end of the directory line in Git Bash. 
Using the git branch command should give you a list of branches, with August 2022 Itertaion havinga green star alongside it.

To switch back to main: 
git checkout main
